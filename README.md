🚨 Antivirus Warning Guide
If your antivirus flags this program as dangerous, it's likely a false positive. Some antivirus software might mistakenly mark it due to how the code is written.

What to do:
1-Check the Code: This project is open-source, and you can review the code on GitHub to make sure it's safe. 🔍

2-Ignore the Warning (If Safe): If you trust the source, you can temporarily disable your antivirus and run the program. ⚠️

3-Report the False Positive: You can submit the file to your antivirus provider for review. 📩

Thanks for understanding! 😊
